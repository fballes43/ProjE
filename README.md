# ProjE

This repository contains my **solutions to Project Euler problems 1–100**.  

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Showcase my **programming skills**.
- Demonstrate my **problem-solving abilities**.
- Serve as a **personal portfolio** for coding practice.
- Maintain and sharpen my **C++ programming skills** through personal and portfolio projects.  

## About Project Euler Problems

- Project Euler problems are designed to be solved individually to gain the full learning experience.  
- This repository **only includes problems 1–100**, which are allowed to be shared publicly for educational purposes.  
- Problem statements are **paraphrased summaries**; the original problems can be found at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).  

## Usage

- The solutions are provided for reference and learning.  
- Readers are encouraged to **attempt the problems themselves before consulting these solutions**.
